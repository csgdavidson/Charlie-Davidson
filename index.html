			<p> Hi, I'm Charlie. A Digital Project Manager and Certified Scrum Master, based in Oxfordshire.</p>

			<p> Ten years as a DPM has taught me that good people can win and teams want to work for people that inspire. Roles that Digital Project Managers can play a huge part in.  </p>

			<p> When I was young, I wanted a career where I interacted with people. I like getting involved, working with people, and building concepts into solutions. I've come to love a good process too.</p>

			<p> My career started at <a href="https://www.sitekit.net/" target="_blank"> Sitekit</a>, at a time where you built a website twice, a second time for Internet Explorer 6.  Four years taught me the basics but also a desire to work on broader projects.</p>

			<p> My first "true" agency role was at <a href="https://www.urbanelement.com/" target="_blank"> Urban Element</a>. Run in a way which left the team to it. We were a bunch of twenty-somethings who didn't always have answers but learned it along the way!</p>

			<p> Next was <a href="https://www.ridgeway.com/" target="_blank"> Ridgeway</a>, an agency punching above its weight and winning impressive projects. My four years there were rewarding and humbling, learning about agency office politics. I also learned what a group of special individuals can achieve when they group together.</p>

			<p> At the start of the year, I joined <a href="https://growcreate.co.uk/" target="_blank"> GrowCreate</a>. A company at an exciting stage in its growth and one I'm enjoying contributing to its evolution.

			<p> This year I've given up social media and haven't looked back. You can still find my poor attempts at writing on <a href="https://medium.com/@csgdavidson" target="_blank"> Medium</a> and my photos on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/farlie/" target="_blank"> Flickr</a>.
