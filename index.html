			<p> Hi, I'm Charlie. A Digital Project Manager and Scrum Master in Oxfordshire.</p>

			<p> Born in Inverness and raised in Cromarty, I went to Fortrose Academy and completed my undergraduate at Stirling University. I've worked with digital agencies for eleven years and enjoy working with people, building solutions, and refining processes.</p>

			<p> My digital career started at <a href="https://www.sitekit.net/" target="_blank">Sitekit</a>. In 2009 you built a website and then again for IE6. I learnt the basics but also desired to work on broader projects.</p>

			<p> I joined <a href="https://www.urbanelement.com/" target="_blank"> Urban Element</a>to get that. We were a bunch of twenty-somethings who didn't always have answers but learned along the way!</p>

			<p> Next was <a href="https://www.ridgeway.com/" target="_blank"> Ridgeway</a>, an agency with impressive projects. My four years were rewarding and humbling, learning the best and worst of agency life.</p>

			<p> At the start of 2019, I joined <a href="https://growcreate.co.uk/" target="_blank">GrowCreate</a> and have had a blast since. I expect to see exciting things from them going forward.</p>

			<p> I also gave up social media in 2019 and haven't looked back. You can find my last online presence at <a href="https://medium.com/@csgdavidson" target="_blank"> Medium</a> though.</p>
