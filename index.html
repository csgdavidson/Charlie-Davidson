			<p> Hi, I'm Charlie. A Digital Project Manager and Scrum Master in Oxfordshire.</p>

			<p> Born in Inverness and raised in Cromarty. I was a student at Fortrose Academy and completed my undergraduate at Stirling University.</p>
			
			<p> With a decades experience with digital agencies, I enjoy working with people, building solutions, and refining processes.</p>

			<p> My career started at <a href="https://www.sitekit.net/" target="_blank"> Sitekit</a>, in a time where you built a website and then a second time for Internet Explorer 6.  Four years with them taught me the basics but also gave me a desire to work on broader projects.</p>

			<p> My first "true" agency role was at <a href="https://www.urbanelement.com/" target="_blank"> Urban Element</a>, where the team were left to it. We were a bunch of twenty-somethings who didn't always have answers but learned it along the way!</p>

			<p> Next was <a href="https://www.ridgeway.com/" target="_blank"> Ridgeway</a>, an agency punching above its weight and winning impressive projects. My four years were rewarding and humbling, learning the best and the worst of agency life.</p>

			<p> At the start of 2019 I joined <a href="https://growcreate.co.uk/" target="_blank"> GrowCreate</a>. A company at an exciting stage in its growth and one I'm enjoying contributing too.

			<p> In 2019 I also gave up social media and haven't looked back. You can find my last online presence at <a href="https://medium.com/@csgdavidson" target="_blank"> Medium</a> which contains some further thoughts.
